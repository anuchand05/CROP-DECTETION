# CROP-DISEASE-DECTETION

Crop disease detection using machine learning involves analyzing images of plants to identify and classify diseases accurately, enabling timely intervention to improve agricultural yield. This typically involves building a model using datasets of labeled crop images, preprocessing them for noise reduction, applying techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, and training classification algorithms to predict the presence of diseases.
